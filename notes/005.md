# Convenience Methods

A month duration (not a calendar month...) from it's starting day to
ending day, is now a single method:

    // Month duration strict
    val monthDur = Scalendar.now.month.duration
    
    // Month duration appearing like a traditional Calendar
    val calMonth = Scalendar.now.calendarMonth

    // Week duration appearing like a traditional Calendar
    val calWeek = Scalendar.now.calendarWeek

    // Day duration appearing like a traditional Calendar
    val calDay = Scalendar.now.calendarDay

A `Scalendar` can now tell you how many occurrences of a day there are
in a given month. ie: How many Mondays are in June?

    val current = Scalendar.now
 
    val june = current.month.duration
 
    // Given all midnight times on a day 
    val mondays = june occurrencesOf Monday 
    
    // How many?
    mondays size
    
    // Operate on them?
    mondays filter (_.day.value < 21) map doSomething

    // Just print them out
    mondays map (_.day.value) foreach println

# 2.7.7 is broken now

This developer only support the lowest possible version of Scala
in plugin development. In sbt 0.7.7, it was 2.7.7. With the release
of 0.10 it is now 2.8.1 (I support 2.8.0 as well because it just works). 

# Bug fixes

  * Time is created properly (order matters, go figure)
