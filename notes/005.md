# Convenience Methods

A month duration (not a calendar month...) from it's starting day to
ending day, is now a single method:

    // Month duration strict
    val monthDur = Scalendar.now.month.duration
    
    // Month duration appearing like a traditional Calendar
    val calMonth = Scalendar.now.calendarMonth

    // Week duration appearing like a traditional Calendar
    val calWeek = Scalendar.now.calendarWeek

    // Day duration appearing like a traditional Calendar
    val calDay = Scalendar.now.calendarDay

A `Scalendar` can now tell you how many occurrences of a day there are
in a given month. ie: How many Mondays are in June?

    val current = Scalendar.now
 
    val june = current.month.duration
 
    // Given all midnight times on a day 
    val mondays = june occurrencesOf Monday 
    
    // How many?
    mondays size
    
    // Operate on them?
    mondays filter (_.day.value < 21) map doSomething

    // Just print them out
    mondays map (_.day.value) foreach println

# Bug fixes

  * Time is created properly (order matters, go figure)
