## New Operations 

Hourly operations can be performed from a `Scalendar`. New Operations include
determining what time of day it is, ie:

    val now = Scalendar.now.hour(22)
    now.isPM // true
    now.isAM // false
    now.isDawn // hours 0 - 6 false
    now.isMorning // hours 6 - 11.59 false
    now.isEvening // hours 12 - 17.59 false
    now.isNight // hours 18 + true

## Calendar Constants

New constants to aid developers are located conveniently in the `scalendar` package object.
These are:
    
    `Month.values`
    `Day.values`
    `Day.Sunday`
    `Month.April`
    // etc

This is now a legal Scalendar creation:
  
    import Month._
    import Day._
    val now = Scalendar(year = 2011, month = April)

    now.day.inWeek(Friday)

    // This is equivalent to...
    Scalendar(year = 2011, month = 4)
   
    // Sunday is 1 
    now.day.inWeek(6)

## Features

  * New operations (hours and `inWeek` setter)
  * Calendar constants moved to package Enums namely: `Month` and `Day`
  * Severed `java.util.Calendar` constants for date creation.
  
## Fixes

  * `calendarWeek` actually returns a correct Duration
  * `now.hour` setter sets hours in a day correctly
  * project dependency no longer requires scalatest at compile time (sorry!)
