## Forward <-> Backward Compatibility

Why? Why would I do such a thing? Scalendar needed support for plugin development, dood!

From 2.9.0 to 2.7.7, you can use Scalendar everywhere now!

## Timezone support

Scalendar will build a time based on the timezone you provide explicitly

    // Normal Object creation

    // You machine's timezone
    val now = Scalendar.now

    val tz = now.tz

    // UTC offset
    val offset = now.tz.offset
    
    // Display name of the TimeZone
    tz.name
    
    // TimeZone ID
    tz.id

## Time Periods

Scalendar already extracts millisecond information quite nicely, but what was missing
was the ability to string together arbitrary calendar fields and convert to
different arbitrary fields. I call these time periods.

    val p = 1.week + 3.days + 4.hours

    // How many milliseconds are in this period?
    println(p.milliseconds)

    // How many days?
    println(p.into.days)
    
    // Hours?
    println(p.into.hours)

    // etc...

This was especially useful for setting Timers, and what not...

    import Scalendar.{ beginDay, now }
    val timer = new java.util.Timer()

    val task = new java.util.TimerTask {
      def run = println("Hello good sir")
    }

    // To start
    val start = beginDay(now + 1.day)
    val delay = 1.day

    timer.schedule(task, start, delay.milliseconds)
