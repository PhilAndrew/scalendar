## Removed Double Imports

Before you would need to

    import com.github.philcali.scalendar._
    // For Conversions
    import implicits._

Now we are back to a single import

    // In 2.8 + you simply need this
    import com.github.philcali.scalendar._
    // In 2.7 you need
    import com.github.philcali.scalendar.Imports._

The `Imports` object contains the appropriate aliases, but
I'm not a big fan of the indirection. I'd prefer the implicits
to be on the package object, but making this library cross
compatible was a priority.

## Minor Enhancments

  * `Evaluted` and `Period` now inherit from `PeriodBuilder`, thus removing an implicit.
  * Added Evaluated field objects. Now you don't have to know how the fields map to
`java.util.Calendar` fields. Here's an example:

        import conversions._
        
        def determineYear(evald: Evaluated) evald match {
          case Years(n) => println("passed in %d years" format(n))
          case _ => println("Give me a year >:(")
        }

        determineYear(4.years) // passed in 4 years
        determineYear(8.months) // Give me a year >:(

## Fixed bugs

  * Corrected conversion to `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar`
  * Some months have "6" weeks, geez

## Example Program with test-run

In sbt run `test-run` for an example run.
