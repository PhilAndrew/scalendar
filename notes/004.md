## Removed Double Imports

Before you would need to

    import com.github.philcali.scalendar._
    // For Conversions
    import implicits._

Now we are back to a single import

    import com.github.philcali.scalendar._

## Fixed bugs

  * Corrected conversion to `java.util.Date`
  * Some months have "6" weeks, geez

## Example Program with test-run

In sbt run `test-run` for an example run.
